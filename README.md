# Geographic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences: a global comparison of the genetic diversity of the virus,

The purpose of carrying out this study is to achieve a global comparison of the genetic diversity of SARS-COV-2. Our hypothesis is that in different countries around the world the original characteristics of the SARS-COV-2 sequences will change by a certain percentage. This can be due to many factors, for example the climate and the geographical area. Therefore, the research questions to be answered are the following: Are the variants very different between each country? Is SARS-CoV-2 different between different countries?
